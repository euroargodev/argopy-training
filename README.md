# 🎓 Repository for Argopy training camps

This repository is dedicated to host the material required for Argopy training sessions.

## 🛠️ Get ready

**You will need to set up your Python environment with [the last Argopy version](https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy/releases/latest) and all required dependencies.**

> Note that Argopy training camps do not start with an installation tutorial. We expect from attendees a working Argopy environment to start the training.

Since all the training material is provided as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install), you will also need to set up **Jupyter** (we recommend JupyterLab) and install the Python kernel where you installed Argopy.

To get you started though, installation and setup instructions are given in the [get_ready](./get_ready) folder of this repository.

## 📚 Training content

A typical Argopy training camp is organized in 2 sessions.

- a general introduction to Argopy,
- practice with thematic notebooks.

All the training content is available in the [content](./content) folder of this repository.
